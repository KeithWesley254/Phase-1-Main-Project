# Phase-1-Main-Project

# Title: 
Video Gallery, Free Games and MMO updates

# Author:

# Description: 
The app will provide the latest MMO news and updates. It will have a nice gallery of videos that may range from popular videos on the internet to simple collections of interesting historical videos, educational, and anything I find interesting.

This will be very convenient for storing videos in one place, quick entertainment and information about the MMO genre of the gaming industry.

# Instructions:
The video gallery is currently for personal use as I await to learn the server side of things. I will add
more interactivity to it so you can view the top weekly videos for example and get a chance to add your videos to the pile.
